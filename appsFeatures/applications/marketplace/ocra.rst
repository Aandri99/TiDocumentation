OCRA â€“ Open Source Console for Real-Time Acquisition / MRI
**********************************************************

OCRA stands for Open-source Console for Real-time Acquisition. It is a low-cost, open-source
console (hardware controller) for MRI running on `STEMLab/Red Pitaya 125-14 <https://redpitaya.com/shop/>`_ board.
Conventional MRI consoles may be high cost, closed-source, and inflexible, in that it is not
possible to change acquisition parameters once the scan is started. In contrast, OCRA is under
$500, open-source, and capable of real-time updates: the console can make changes to the
pulse sequence based on the acquired data, enabling closed-loop control of the scan.
