EMC, or electromagnetic compatibility, is the property of the equipment that tells us about the devices' emission of unwanted electromagnetic energy and how they behave in an interfered environment. It also tells us what effects the emitted energy has. This application is used for measuring the magnetic field that is part of unintended or unwanted electromagnetic emissions. When using this application, an additional front-end is needed where the application (through gain parameters) can be adjusted to the users of front-ends.
