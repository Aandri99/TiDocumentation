SDR â€“ Software Defined Radio (by Pavel Demin)
*********************************************

Alongside other instruments, the Red Pitaya board can be used as a SDR platform. A
simple installation of the SDR Transceiver application will transform your RedPitaya
board into a SDR platform. To run the SDR on the RedPitaya board you will need to
install one of the following types of SDR software such as HDSDR, SDR#, PowerSDR
mRX PS, GNU Radio or similar.

You can find more about the SDR software on the link:
