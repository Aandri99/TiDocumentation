Marketplace and contributed apps

.. note::

    Due to its unpopularity, we have decided to move away from the Application Marketplace. This means that the Application Marketplace will no longer be available in future OS versions. All unique applications will be moved to the official Red Pitaya OS and will be accessible from the main web interface page.

.. note::

    Unless the authors have updated the applications, all applications in the Application Marketplace are **obsolete** for the 2.00 OS releases. Please check the linked pages for information on updates.
    Applications created by Pavel Demin and PyRPL are exceptions to this rule, as they both work with the latest OS releases.


==========
Overview
==========

More Red Pitaya applications can be obtained from the Red Pitaya marketplace that is accessible through the Red Pitaya WEB interface or from other websites where Red Pitaya community members share code or complete software packages that can be installed and run on Red Pitaya hardware platforms.

.. note:: 

   It is important to note that applications developed by the Red Pitaya community are not distributed or tested by the Red Pitaya team, and that our team accepts no responsibility. If you'd like to share feedback, report bugs, or need help on contributed projects, apps, or software, we highly recommend contacting the project authors.


To download the applications from the application marketplace, **Red Pitaya must have access to the internet**, otherwise the Marketplace Application will fail to open.

The easiest way to ensure this is to connect your Red Pitaya to the router (either through :ref:`Wi-Fi <wireless>` or :ref:`ethernet cable <LAN>`). Alternatively, if you are a network expert, some network settings must be tweaked to pass your computers internet connection to the Red Pitaya (when Red Pitaya is :ref:`directly connected to the computer <dir_cab_connect>`).
