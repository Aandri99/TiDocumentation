****************************************

A vector network analyzer (VNA) is an instrument that measures the network parameters of electrical networks (commonly s-parameters). Vector network analyzers are often used to characterise two-port networks such as amplifiers and filters, but they can be used on networks with an arbitrary number of ports. This application will enable measurements of the desired DUT (Device Under Test), providing the measured results and parameters, such as:

* Impedance
* SWR
* Reflection coefficient - Gama
* Return loss.

The measurements are nicely represented on the Smith chart. You can find more about the Vector Network Analyzer at this link:
