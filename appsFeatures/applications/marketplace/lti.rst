LTI DSP Workbench
*****************

This application will model a physical system, turning the Red Pitaya board into almost any linear system that can be included in the measuring and control circuitry. The physical system is modelled by simulating the system's H(z) transfer function using the Red Pitaya board. There are some predefined H(z) functions in the application that will assist you in describing or simulating the desired system. Changing the parameters of the H(z) transfer function is done quickly through the applicationâ€™s web interface.
