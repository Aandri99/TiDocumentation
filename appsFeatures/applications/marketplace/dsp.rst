DSP sandbox ( free graphical DSP design tool by Pau Gomez)
**********************************************************

Canvas is a free graphical DSP design tool that gives access to custom FPGA
designs, specially suited for prototyping and users without prior knowledge on
HDL languages or FPGA architectures.
In short, a Canvas project consists of a DSP drawing, which is sent to a remote
server for automatic VHDL generation, synthesis and implementation. The
configuration and loading of the generated output products onto the host FPGA
(Red Pitaya STEMLab 125-14) is performed through an intuitive graphical user
interface (GUI).
