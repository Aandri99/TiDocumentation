DSP Sandbox (free graphical DSP design tool by Pau Gomez)
**********************************************************

Canvas is a free graphical DSP design tool that gives access to custom FPGA designs, specially suited for prototyping and users without prior knowledge of HDL languages or FPGA architectures. In short, a Canvas project consists of a DSP drawing, which is sent to a remote server for automatic VHDL generation, synthesis, and implementation. The configuration and loading of the generated output products onto the host FPGA (Red Pitaya STEMLab 125-14) is performed through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).
