RadioBox - (by Urlich Habel)
****************************

The RadioBox is a complete transmitter and receiver done on the FPGA. You can directly connect an antenna to the SMA RF In 2 port for receiving. At the SMA RF Out 2 port, you can listen to the demodulated signal. The transmitter does it at the same time on the SMA In/Out 1 connectors. When an external SDR-software is desired, you can select the Linux AC97 sound driver as stereo channels in both directions to feed the FPGA or to grab the data streams. To connect to a SDR, you can set the two AC97 channels to the I- and Q-signals of the QMIXers modulation.

More details about the project can be found at the Wiki of RadioBox at the following link:Â
