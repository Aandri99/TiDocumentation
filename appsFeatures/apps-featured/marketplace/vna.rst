Vector Network Analyzer (by Pavel Demin)
****************************************

A vector network analyzer (VNA) is an instrument that measures the network
parameters of electrical networks (commonly s-parameters). Vector network analyzers
are often used to characterize two-port networks such as amplifiers and filters, but they
can be used on networks with an arbitrary number of ports. This application will enable
measurements of the desired DUT (Device Under Test) providing the measured
results/parameters, such as:

* Impedance
* SWR
* Reflection coefficient - Gama
* Return loss.

The measurements are nicely represented on the Smith chart. You can find more about
the vector network analyzer at this link:
