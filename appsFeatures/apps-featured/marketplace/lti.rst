*****************
LTI DSP Workbench
*****************

This application will model a physical system,
turning the Red Pitaya board into almost any linear system
that can be included into a measuring and control circuitry.
The modeling of the physical system is done by simulating
the system H(z) transfer function with the Red Pitaya board.
In the application there are some predefined H(z) functions
which will help you describe/simulate the desired system.
Changing the parameters of the H(z) transfer function
is done quickly through the applicationâ€™s web interface.

   LTI DSP workbench application is available on Red Pitaya marketplace.
