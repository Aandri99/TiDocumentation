.. note::

        We recommend the usage of the Network Manager application for RedPitaya connection settings. However, if :ref:`local network access <networkManager>`, which is needed to run the Network Manager application, is not available, it is still possible to :ref:`connect manually <network>`.


Red Pitaya boards are network attachable devices focused on simple connectivity and quick accessibility. Having a graphical user interface for your Oscilloscope, Signal Generator, LCR meter, and other Red Pitaya applications directly on your PC without any limitations such as limited commands or controls or any installation of additional software will provide you with a unique working experience.


You can connect to the Red Pitaya boards via:

#. **Local Area Network (LAN)** - Requires a DHCP server on your LAN router
#. **Direct Ethernet cable connection** - Requires additional settings on users' PC and the Red Pitaya board
#. **Wireless Network Client** - Requires an additional WiFi dongle available at the Red Pitaya store
#. **Access Point Mode** - The Red Pitaya board creates its WiFi network
