Setting up the serial console
###############################

The debug console can be used to follow the boot process:

1. **FSBL** (if debug mode is enabled)

   The serial console can also be used to see the output 
   of other bare metal applications, for example, the memory test.


2. **U-Boot**

   During the boot process, U-Boot will show status and debug information.

   After FSBL starts U-Boot, there is a 3-second delay before U-Boot starts the Linux kernel.
   If during this time a key is pressed, U-boot will stop the boot process and give the user access to its shell.


3. **Linux console**

   During the boot process, Linux will show status and debug information.

   When ``systemd`` reaches ``multi-user.target`` a login prompt will appear.

      User name: ``root``
      Password: ``root``


Hardware setup
==============

Here is a list of additional hardware you will need to set up the serial console:

- **All STEMlab 125-14 and SDRlab 122-16 models** - USB to micro USB cable.
- **SIGNALlab 250-12** - USB to USB-C cable
- **STEMlab 125-10** - serial to USB adapter (the pins must first be soldered onto the board)

The following instructions are written for the STEMlab 125-14. For other boards, the procedure is the same, but the cable connection may differ.

Connect your Red Pitaya and PC with a micro USB to USB-A cable and follow the instructions for your OS.

.. figure:: img/pitaya-USB-connection-300x164.png
   :width: 400


Software requirements
======================

Windows
--------

Download and install the |FTDI driver| on your PC. After installation, a new COM port will appear in the Device Manager, which you can use in Hyperterminal or another terminal utility to connect to Red Pitaya.
Connect your Red Pitaya to the micro USB port on the board. In your terminal utility, fill in the serial port name and set the **speed to 115200**.

.. |FTDI driver| raw:: html

   <a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm" target="_blank">FTDI driver</a>


To adjust the connection settings for serial communication, right-click on the COM port and select Properties.

.. figure:: img/device_manager.png

.. figure:: img/Comm_port.png

Boot reference must be done through ``Minicom`` or a similar serial console application.

One of the options is to install the WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and then install the relevant tools for the console interface (``usbipd``).
Here are the relevant links:

* |WSL| (install the latest available Linux Ubuntu version)
* |Connect USB Devices|

.. |WSL| raw:: html

   <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install" target="_blank">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a>

.. |Connect USB Devices| raw:: html

   <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/connect-usb" target="_blank">Connect USB devices</a>


Here is a quick reference guide for using the WSL to connect to the Red Pitaya console:

1. Open *Windows terminal* and type ``wsl`` to start the Windows Subsystem for Linux (from now on reffered to as WSL terminal). This window will be used to establish the serial console connection.
2. Open a separate instance of *Windows terminal*, which we will use for connecting the USB device to the WSL (from now on reffered to as Windows terminal).
3. In the Windows terminal list all available USB devices. Find the "bus-id" of the Red Pitaya console. It should be listed as *USB Serial Converter*:
   
   .. code-block:: bash
      
      usbipd list

4. Bind the Red Pitaya console to the WSL.

   .. code-block:: bash

      usbipd bind --busid <bus-id>   

5. Attach the USB serial converter to the WSL.

   .. code-block:: bash

      usbipd attach --wsl --busid <bus-id>

   Here is a visual representation of the commands so far:

   .. figure:: img/windows_terminal_commands.png
      :width: 1000

6. In the WSL terminal, list all available USB devices. The Red Pitaya console should be listed as *ttyUSB0*:

   .. code-block:: bash

      lsusb

   .. figure:: img/wsl_lsusb.png
      :width: 1000

7. Continue to the *Establishing serial console connection* chapter
8. To disconnect the Red Pitaya console from the WSL, use the following commands in the Windows terminal:

   .. code-block:: bash

      usbipd detach --busid <bus-id>

The full instructions are available on the |Connect USB Devices| page.


Linux and Mac
--------------

There is broad support for USB-to-serial converters in the Linux kernel, so in most cases the converter will be detected soon after it is plugged in.

- |minicom|, |screen| or a similar program for setting up a remote serial console.



Establishing serial console connection
=======================================

At this point you should have the Red Pitaya connected to your PC via a USB-to-serial converter and are able to access the Linux terminal either throught the WSL or naturally from the Linux.

Check the driver output in the kernel log using ``dmesg``:

.. code-block:: none
   :emphasize-lines: 11

   $ dmesg
   ...
   [95074.784075] usb 1-2.4.3: new full-speed USB device number 20 using ehci-pci

   [95074.885416] usb 1-2.4.3: SerialNumber: DN003P0Q
   [95074.890105] ftdi_sio 1-2.4.3:1.0: FTDI USB Serial Device converter detected
   [95074.890228] usb 1-2.4.3: Detected FT-X
   [95074.891157] usb 1-2.4.3: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB0


The first Red Pitaya board connected to your PC will create a device named ``/dev/ttyUSB0``. If **N** USB or serial devices are connected, they will appear as ``/dev/ttyUSBn``, where **n** is **{0, 1, ..., N-1}**. To access these devices, programs should be run with ``sudo``.

Minicom or a similar serial console application must be used to view the boot reference log.


``minicom``
------------

Minicom is a text-based modem control and terminal emulation program. It is commonly used for setting up a remote serial console.


To configure ``minicom`` use the ``-s`` option.

.. code-block:: shell-session

   sudo minicom -s


A configuration menu will open.

.. code-block:: none

Go to ``Serial Port Setup``, press **Enter**, and set up the next options:

* Serial Device: ``/dev/ttyUSB0`` (device index ``0`` or a higher number)
* Bps/Par/Bits: ``115200 8N1`` (baud rate, byte length, parity, and stop bits)
* Hardware/Software Flow Control: No (flow control should be disabled)

   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+


``Minicom`` requires some special ``Control+A`` key sequences to operate. The most common commands you will need are:
   
   - ``Control+A`` followed by ``X`` to exit Minicom
   - ``Control+A`` followed by ``Z`` to open the help menu

Please see the |minicom| manual for details.


.. |minicom| raw:: html

   <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/minicom" target="_blank">Minicom</a>

After you have configured the details, exit the settings. At this point Minicom should be connected to your Red Pitaya:

.. figure:: img/Minicom_connected.png
   :width: 1000

If you are asked to log in into the Red Pitaya, please use the following credentials:

   - **User name:** ``root``
   - **Password:** ``root``

Leave the Minicom open and unplug Red Pitaya from power. After plugging it back in, you should see the boot sequence for Red Pitaya.

At the begginning of the boot sequence, you can press any key to stop the autoboot process and enter the Zynq U-Boot shell. This is useful for debugging and changing the boot parameters.

.. figure:: img/Minicom_zynq_boot.png
   :width: 1000



If you are not able to see the boot sequence, please check the connection between the Red Pitaya and your PC, and the settings in Minicom.


``screen``
------------

GNU ``screen`` is, in general, a terminal multiplexer. It also supports connecting to a serial console and provides syntax to configure the serial connection's baud rate, byte length, parity, and flow control.

Compared to ``Minicom``, it provides better fonts and support for terminal window resizing.

.. code-block:: shell-session

   $ sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB1 115200 cs8

Similar to ``Minicom``, ``screen`` requires some special ``Control+A`` key sequences to operate.
Please see the |screen| manual for details.

.. |screen| raw:: html

   <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html" target="_blank">screen</a>

The configuration is the same as for ``Minicom``. Please refer to the previous section for details.

FAQ
======

I cannot see the boot sequence on the serial console.
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Make sure that the serial console is connected to the correct port and that the baud rate is set to 115200.
2. Check whether the FTDI drivers for Windows are installed correctly.
3. Check the status LEDs on Red Pitaya:

   - If the **green and blue LEDs are ON** and the other status LEDs are working correctly, unplug the power and repower the board. If the issue persists, please double-check the serial console instructions above or use a different cabel.
   
   - If the **green LED is ON**, but no other LEDs are visible, this means that the boot process is stuck:
      
      -  Please check whether the Red Pitaya OS is installed on the SD card.
      -  If the OS is installed correctly and the boot log is not visible, the Zynq SoC might be damaged. In this case, please contact Red Pitaya support (support@redpitaya.com).
         If the board is still under warranty, we will replace it.

   - If the **green LED is OFF**, please check whether the power supply is connected and working correctly. If the power supply is good, then the board might be damaged.
