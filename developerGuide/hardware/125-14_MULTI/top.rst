STEMlab 125-14 X-Channel System
###################################

The X-Channel STEMlab 125-14 system consists of multiple STEMlab 125-14 devices that are modified for clock and trigger synchronization, and also comes with SATA synchronization cables and software that supports multi channel RF signal acquisition and generation.

X-Channel STEMlab 125-14 system consists of:

* one MASTER STEMlab 125-14 device which is standard STEMlab 125-14 device and provides main clock and trigger to other SLAVE STEMlab 125-14 devices
* one or multiple SLAVE STEMlab 125-14 devices, that are modified in a way that they can receive clock and trigger from a MASTER device and distribute it to the next SLAVE device. These are marked with an “S” sticker.

For detailed hardware specifications for STEMlab 125-14 devices used in the STEMlab 125-14 X-Channel System please refer to :ref:`STEMlab 125-14 standard specs <top_125_14>`.
