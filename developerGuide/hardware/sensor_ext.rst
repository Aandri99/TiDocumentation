Sensor extension module
#########################

The Sensor extension board redirects the digital and analog pins so that Groove sensors are easily connected. It also has the same pinout as Arduino shields.

Each of the Groove connectors is connected to the power (3V3), ground, and either two digital or two analog pins. As Red Pitaya only has four analog inputs, some pins overlap. You can control the pins and the sensors attached by reading data from either digital or analog pins.

Code examples on how to control the digital and analog inputs and outputs are available :ref:`here <examples>`.
