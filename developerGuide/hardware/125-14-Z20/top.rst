STEMlab 125-14-Z7020-LN is a standard STEMlab 125-14 board that:


* comes with zynq 7020 (instead of 7010) that beside 3 times more FPGA logic provides
also more digital IOs on the E2 connector (for more information refer to board
schematics)

* has populated additional linear analog power for analog power supplies to reduce RF
inputs and outputs noise and consequently increase ENOB.To find out more about the
performance of STEMlab 125-14 with DC analog power supplies, refer to Leonhard
Neuhaus's blog `Red Pitaya DAC performance <https://ln1985blog.wordpress.com/2016/02/07/red-pitaya-dac-performance/>`_.
