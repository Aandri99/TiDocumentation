STEMlab 125-14 4-Input
######################

STEMlab 125-14 4-Input is a single-board RF signal acquisition platform that offers the same general hardware features as STEMlab 125-14. The main differences/benefits are that:

* There are 4 analog input channels @ 125Msps & 14 bits (instead of 2 inputs and 2 outputs).
* RF inputs come with better performance (less crosstalk, noise, and distortions).
* Zynq 7020 (bigger FPGA that offers more processing capabilities and more digital IO pins available on the extension connector).
* Switching between internal and external clocks can be done using a jumper or control signal on the extension connector.
* The internal ADC clock can be locked to an external reference clock via an extension connector (this feature is only available upon customer request).
