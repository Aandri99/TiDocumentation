    Components of the Red Pitaya Aluminium Case.
    
Contents:
    - 4 screws that close the housing and hold the board
    - 4 rubber feet for secure positioning on the desk
    - a thermal pad (just barely seen in the photo)
    - a transparent plastic rod that guides the light of a red LED (Ready/CPU activity) to the top of the casing

   Interior of the Red Pitaya Aluminium Case.
    

On the interior, there is a block located in the upper part of the housing (right) that passes the heat to the housing. Therefore, the entire case acts as a heat sink.

On the lower part, there are fits for a few air vents (left).

Apertures in the case expose connections to the expansion ports **E1** and **E2**.
