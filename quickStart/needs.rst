Additional required items which are not provided with the Red Pitaya kits:

- computer with an internet browser (Google Chrome is recommended),
- router with DHCP server enabled and access to the internet.

.. note::

   Red Pitaya boards should not be powered by a power supply that provides less power than specified or has very thin power wires, since this will result in abnormal behaviour of the device, causing reboots and network disconnections.Â 
   The same problem might appear if the Red Pitaya board is powered directly from USB on a PC or HUB that cannot provide enough power or when using a bad power cable.
