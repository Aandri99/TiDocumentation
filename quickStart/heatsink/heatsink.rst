Red Pitaya heatsink interface setup
####################################

The heatsink interface is CNC drilled from aluminium to match the profile of STEMlab 125-14. It connects to the bottom side of the STEMlab 125-14 and has additional holes to connect the interface (attached to the board) to a bigger heatsink for even better heat dispersion.

Before the assembly
======================

Before the assembly begins, please consider where the Red Pitaya with the heatsink interface will be mounted. Depending on your setup, additional preparation might be necessary. For example, drilling holes into the metalic surface the assembly is going to be connected to or selecting an appropriate external heatsink (with appropriate hole patterns).

If you have the Red Pitaya aluminium case, it is possible to attach the top side of the aluminium case to the Red Pitaya with the heatsink interface. In this case the four screws that connect the heatsink interface, Red Pitaya board, and the top side of aluminium case should be attached from the bottom side, so some additional planning might be necessary. Should you opt for this, please see the alternative instructions at the end.



Assembly instructions
======================

#. Remove the small plastic feet by pressing the clips at the top with a small pair of pliers and pushing the feet down.

#. Repeat the procedure with the top side heat sink by pressing the clips together on the bottom and pushing the holder gently up.

#. Remove the remainder of the thermal paste.
#. Place the heatsink interface in front of you.

#. Take the dark gray thermal pad. This is a special thermal pad that has protection foil on both sides. Remove the protection foil from the side facing the heatsink interface and attach it to the heatsink interface. Please be careful to remove the foil from the correct side as the pad is not symetrical. This is how the interface should look afterwards. The top side of thermal pad stil has foil attached at this point.

#. Remove the protection foil from the top side of the thermal pad.
#. Place the Red Pitaya board into the heatsink interface, bottom side down. Make sure that the holes from the board and the interface are aligned.

#. Install the four M3 screws that connect the Red Pitaya to the heatsink interface.
#. Turn the assembly around.

Assembly with top side of aluminium case
=========================================

Follow the :ref:`aluminium case assembly instructions <alucase>` to assemble the aluminium case, until step 8 or remove the screws if already present.

#. Remove the four screws.
#. Hold the aluminium case with the Red Pitaya board togther and place it upside down.
#. Remove the bottom part of the aluminium case.
#. Place the heatsink interface in front of you.

#. Remove the protection foil from the top side of the thermal pad.
#. Use the heatsink interface and the top side of the aluminium case to enclose the Red Pitaya board. Make sure that the holes from the board and the interface are aligned.
#. Install four M3 screws to hold the assembly together. You might need to modify the external heatsink to adjust for the screw heads.
