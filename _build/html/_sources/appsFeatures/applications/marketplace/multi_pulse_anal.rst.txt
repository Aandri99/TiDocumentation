Multichannel Pulse Height Analyzer – (by Pavel Demin)
*****************************************************

The Multichannel Pulse Height Analyzer (MCPHA) is an instrument used for the analysis of electrical signals in the form of pulses of varying heights, which may come from different sensors and similar. The pulse signals are acquired where the number of pulses of each height is saved and the histogram plot is given where the X axis represents the pulses’ amplitude, and the Y axis represents the number of pulses. With the Red Pitaya board, you can acquire pulses whose period can be in the range of 1 us to 1 s.
